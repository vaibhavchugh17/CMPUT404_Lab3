cgi_server.py hosts a simple CGI server. It can be used to test CGI scripts such as hello.py and login.py.
How does it know when to run which script? It looks at the URL path. For example, if you visit http://localhost:8080/hello.py, it will run hello.py. If you visit http://localhost:8080/login.py, it will run login.py.
The files need to be in the same directory as cgi_server.py.

What do the print statements do? They send data to the browser. The first line tells the browser that the data is HTML. The second line is a blank line. The third line is the HTML data. The browser will display the HTML data.
print("Content-Type: text/html") # Tells the browser that the data is HTML

What does os.environ do? It prints out all the environment variables. Environment variables are variables that are set by the operating system. They are used to configure the server.
