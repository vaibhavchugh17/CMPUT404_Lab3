5. To set a cookie from the server, we can use the HTTP header "Set-Cookie".
Syntax: Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>

6. HTTP header that the browser uses to send the cookie back is HTTP_COOKIE.
Syntax: HTTP_COOKIE: <name>=<value>
We can read the cookie using: cookie = SimpleCookie(os.environ.get("HTTP_COOKIE"))

7. Cookies are used to store/cache user data so services can track user activity. 
Use javascript console to mention the cookies yourself.
